Compilation
-----------

AISearch II comes with 3 different sets of makefiles that support
the following compilers:

* GCC 2.5.8 and upwards (using GNU make)
* BCC 3.1
* MSC Visual C++

Step by step instructions:

1. In the top-level directory where you installed AISearch there
   will be 3 makefiles, each supporting one of the compilers
   mentioned above. Decide which one you need.
2. The makefile in the top-level directory contains several settings
   that will be passed to the makefiles in the other directories. Take
   a look at these settings and modify them if necessary.
3. Start the make utility by typing 'make -f <name of makefile>' which
   will build the AISearch library and the executables (plus some extra
   'utility' libraries).

Note: if the compiler (or actually the linker) complains about
'unresolved symbols' go back to the top-level makefile and check out
the section about the flag -DNEED_CAST!

Special instructions for MSC Visual C++:

1. Open a DOS box.
2. Make sure that the environment variables LIB and INCLUDE are set
   to the correct values.
3. Type 'nmake -f makefile.msc'.

I chose to use makefiles because I'm not very familiar with project files.
However, if there's enough demand for project files and someone would be
willing to provide them they'll be included with a new version of AISearch II.

Instructions for other compilers:

If your system does not have any of the mentioned compilers it shouldn't
be too hard to adjust the makefiles to your situation. If you do please
send me a copy of the makefiles you're using and I'll include them with
AIsearch II and put a new version of AISearch II on ftp.
