AISearch II is the sequel of AISearch. AISearch grew out of a project I
once did during an internship. The goal of this project was to develop a
library of algorithms in C++ that would facilitate the development of AI
programs, specifically problem solving software in which search (as in
searching for the solution to a problem) plays a major role. The library
consists of a number of different AI search algorithms that can be used to
solve all kinds of problems. The philosophy of AISearch is that when developing
problem solving software the programmer should be able to concentrate on the
representation of the problem at hand and need not bother with the
implementation of the atcual search algorithm that will conduct the search.
This idea has been realized by the implementation of a set of search classes
that may be incorporated in other software through C++'s features of
derivation and inheritance. AISearch II builds on the work that was done
for AISearch. The search library itself has been heavily modified and
extended:

- New search algortihms.
- Better comments and description files that contain design information.
- Template list and array classes to make better use of C++'s support
  for code reuse and to hide the "gory details" better.
- New, larger and more interesting sample applications.

The following search algorithms have been built into AISearch II:

- Normal (uni-directional) search:
  * depth-first
  * breadth-first
  * uniform-cost
  * A*

- Bi-directional search:
  * depth-first
  * breadth-first

- AND/OR search:
  * depth-first
  * breadth-first
	
- Backtracking

- Minimax:
  * with and without alpha-beta cutoffs

To make use of one of these search algorithms two classes must be
defined, one derived from the desired search class and another from
a so called "node" class that serves as a representation of the problem
states that are generated during the search. AISearch will also help
standardizing the process of turning the representation of the problem into
actual source code because for every problem certain functions which have
been declared 'virtual' in the library must be implemented.

The following sample programs have been included with AISearch II:

- 8puzzle solving program.
- Route finder.
- Natural language parser.
- Logic classes to represent predicates in C++.
- STRIPS based planner.
- Theorem prover for propositional logic. 
- Prolog-like theorem prover.
- Tic Tac Toe.

AISearch II is also featured in a book about AI and C++ of which I'm
co-author: 

	Kim W. Tracy & Peter Bouthoorn, "Object-oriented Artificial
        Intelligence Using C++", Computer Science Press 1996,
        ISBN 0-7167-829404 (hard cover)

As its title suggests this book is about the integration of object-oriented
programming and the principles of AI. If you take interest in these matters
or if AISearch II aroused your curiosity then this book is a must. As
far as I know it is the only book that offers such integrated object-oriented
approach to AI. The C++ source code for the algorithms and applications
presented in the book is taken from AISearch II. Information about the book
can also be found on the WWW on the homepage of W.H. Freeman:

Obtaining AISearch II
---------------------

AISearch II is available on anonymous ftp:

ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/peter/aisrch2.tar.gz	(UNIX version)
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/peter/aisrch2.zip	(DOS/Windows/etc. version)

The two versions of AIsearch II are the same except for the way the package
has been archived and for the extension of the source files (.cc vs cpp).


Documentation
-------------

There's no manual for AISearch II that explains how AISearch II
can be used to develop your own AI programs. I've given up on
writing one as I can't find the time to do it. If you want to use
AIsearch II to develop your own applications take a look at the sample
applications and go from there. Another good starting point would
be the manual of the old search library (called the C++ Search
library) - but keep in mind that a lot has been changed in AISearch II.
You can get the old library through ftp on the following location:

ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/peter/old/aisearch.tar.Z   (UNIX version)
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/peter/old/aisearch.zip     (DOS/Windows/etc. version)

If you stil need help feel free to send me your questions through
e-mail.

If you want to know more about the "inner workings" of AISearch II take
a look at the description files that have been added and at the comments
accompanying the source code. The description files contain design
information. The comments should be helpful even to those that aren't
fully familiar with AI.


Known problems
--------------
* There's an error in either the minimax-class or in the Tic Tac Toe
  program. If a depth of 8 or more is specified incorrect results
  are returned: if you let the computer make the first move it does
  not play its best move. I gave up looking for the cause of this,
  so if anybody finds it please, please let me know!
