CIS 255 Project 3

code due 2/19/97

1) The problem is to fit a power curve to a sequence of
   points (X,Y). You are to use the least-squares fit 
   method to calculate the parameters, A and B, in the
   following equation:

	Y = A*X**B

2) Your program should read in a sequence of (X, Y) points
   and print out the corresponding A and B coefficients.

3) Your program should then calculate the CHI-squared coefficient
   using your A and B coefficients and the same sequence of
   (X, Y) points.

4) Run your program on the following set of points.

	X	Y	
   -------------------
	1	1
	2	3
	3	10
	4	15
	5	27
	6	39
	7	48
	8	60
	9	80
	10	104
	11	120
	12	140
	13	164
	14	200
	15	230

5) Turn in output and flow-chart.
