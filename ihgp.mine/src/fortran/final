CIS 255 FINAL EXAM

1) (10) Write down the CHI-squared expression for the following 
   function and derive the least-squares expressions for the parameters 
   A and B:

	Y = A*exp(B*sin(X))

2) (20) List the steps and explain the method of gaussian elimination 
   with pivoting. What does pivoting do?


3) (20) Write a subroutine implementing the bisection method for finding
   a root x in an interval given by a <= x <= b. Assume that a 
   function f(x) is passed into your subroutine.


4) (20) Write a subroutine implementing Newton's method for finding
   a root x in an interval given by a <= x <= b. Assume that a 
   function f(x) is passed into your subroutine.


5) (10) Assume that variables X and Y are real, and variables I and J are
   integers. Furthermore, assume that X, Y, I and J have the following
   values:

	X = 1.2345
	Y = 9.8765
	I = 12345
	J = 98765

   How does the output appear for the following format statements. Show
   all spaces.

	   PRINT 12, X, Y, I, J
	12 FORMAT(F10.3, T15, F10.3, T29, I10, T43, I10)

	   PRINT 13, X, Y, I, J
	13 FORMAT(' ', F10.3, T15, F10.3, T29, I10, T43, I10)

	   PRINT 14, X, Y, I, J
	14 FORMAT(' ', 2(F10.3, 4X), 2(I10, 4X))

	   PRINT 15, X, Y, I, J
	15 FORMAT(' ', 2(F10.3, 4X), //, 1X, 2(I10, 4X))


6) (20) Solve the following set of equations using gaussian elimination
   WITHOUT pivoting. Explain what happens when E << 1.0.

	E*x + y = 1
	  x + y = 2

   Then solve the above set of equations with pivoting and show how 
   it helps.


7) (20) Write a subroutine to calculate sech(x) to a given precision. 
   That is, using a taylor series, determine where to truncate the 
   series to obtain a given precison and implement it.

   The series representation for sech(x) is given by:

		infinity
		  ---
	sech(x) = \	(-1)**n * E(n) * x**(2*n)
		  /     ------------------------
		  ---        (2*n) !
		  n=0

   where E(n) are the Euler numbers. Assume E(n) and the factorial 
   function (n!) already exist (i.e., you don't have to write them).
