CIS 255 Project 3

flow chart or pseudo-code due 4/29/96
code due 5/6/96

1) The problem is to fit a power curve to a sequence of
   points (X,Y). You are to use the least-squares fit 
   method to calculate the parameters, A and B, in the
   following equation:

	Y = A*X**B

2) Your program should read in a sequence of (X, Y) points
   and print out the corresponding A and B coefficients.

3) Your program should then calculate the CHI-squared coefficient
   using your A and B coefficients and the same sequence of
   (X, Y) points.

4) Run your program on the following set of points.

	X	Y	
   -------------------
	1	1
	2	4
	3	9
	4	16
	5	25
	6	36
	7	49
	8	64
	9	81
	10	100
	11	121
	12	144
	13	169
	14	196
	15	225

5) Turn in output and flow-chart (or pseudo-code).
