# Itâ€™s relatively easy to collapse data in R using one or more 
# by variables and a defined function. The format is
#
# aggregate(x, by, FUN)
#
# where x is the data object to be collapsed, by is a list of 
# variables that will be crossed to form the new observations, and 
# FUN is the scalar function used to calculate summary
# statistics that will make up the new observation values.
#
# aggregate works like "group by" in SQL. it gathers all the
# data for given unique set of values.

# result, and fun.aggregate is the (optional) aggregating function.

# rowvar1 + rowvar2 + ... ~ colvar1 + colvar2 + ...
#
# In this formula, rowvar1 + rowvar2 + ... defines the set of 
# crossed variables that defines the rows, and 
# colvar1 + colvar2 + ... defines the set of crossed 
# variables that defines the columns.
