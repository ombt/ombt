# R currently contains the following “state” data sets. Note that all data are arranged according to alphabetical order of the state names.
# 
# state.abb:
# 
#     character vector of 2-letter abbreviations for the state names.

# 
#     numeric vector of state areas (in square miles).
# state.center:
#

# state.division:
# 
#     factor giving state divisions (New England, Middle Atlantic, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, East North Central, West North Central, Mountain, and Pacific).
# state.name:
# 
#     character vector giving the full state names.

# 
#     matrix with 50 rows and 8 columns giving the following statistics in the respective columns.
