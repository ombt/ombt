The following files are included:

	debug.h
	reader.c
	returns.h
	vsem.c
	vsem.h
	vshm5.h
	writer.c

	make.in
	makefile

Makefile defines the macroes CC and LD to be "CC", that is, the C++ 
compiler is called CC by default. You will have to change these 
definitions if you are using a compiler with a different name. The
Solaris Workshop C++ compiler is called "CC". 

Enter the following command to build writer and reader:

	$ make

To run the example, make sure both the reader and writer executables are in 
the same directory. Change directory to the directory containing the
executables and run:

	$ writer 1 11 111 5

This run writer with three keys 1, 11, 111, and for an array containing
5 elements. The output appears as follows:
