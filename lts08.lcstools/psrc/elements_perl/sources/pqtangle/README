This directory contains the following files:
README          <-- you're reading it
pqtangle        <-- the pqtangle script (with line directives)
pqtangle.nw     <-- the literate source
pqtangle.pdf    <-- the typeset documentation in PDF format
pqtangle.ps     <-- the typeset documentation in postscript format

Typeset output produced by "weaving" the literate source into a .tex
file and then using LaTeX ... finally 'dvips' was used to create the
postscript file. I used pdflatex to generate the PDF file, and the
quality appears better than the previous version using ps2pdf ---
however, you should be aware that some viewers (notably xpdf on my
system) do not render all font symbols (such as the ~ or ^ or the
special angle braces around code chunks). If it looks like characters
are missing, check the .nw source file.
