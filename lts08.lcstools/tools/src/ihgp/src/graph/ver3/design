1.0 problem statement

I need a generic interface for graphics. The interface should support
graphics on several different platforms. The basic drawing functions,
and text writing and reading should be available. The interface should
support multiple windows on a physical device and multiple displays. 
Input is from a keyboard or a pointing device (e.g. a mouse).

The graphics system consists of processes running on a platform and
drawing figures or text in windows. The windows are displayed on one 
or more physical devices, i.e., CRT or LCD. Input comes from a 
pointing device (a mouse) and a keyboard. The processes are built 
with the graphics library.

drawing functions: arcs, lines, circles, boxes, fill regions, fill boxes,
fill arcs, fill circles, writing text using different fonts, reading
text.
