CIS 255 FINAL EXAM			NAME:__________________________

1) (20) Write down the CHI-squared expression for the following 
   function and derive the least-squares expressions for the 
   parameter A:

	Y = sin(A*tan(X**2)) + 1

2) (20) List the steps and explain the method of gaussian elimination 
   with pivoting. What does pivoting do?


3) (20) Write a function implementing the secant method for finding
   a root x in an interval given by a <= x <= b. Assume that a 
   function f(x) is passed into your function.


4) (20) The following program contains errors. Find the errors and
   fix them. The program implements the sieve of Erastosthenes
   for finding prime numbers.

5) (20) You are given the function LINEARFIT() which fits a straight line
   to a series of (X, Y) points, that is, it determines the parameters
   A and B for the following function:

	Y = A + B*X

   The function LINEARFIT has the following definition where X, Y are
   arrays of X and Y points, SZ is the number of points, and A and B
   are the parameters of the above equation and determined by LINEARFIT.

	LOGICAL FUNCTION LINEARFIT(X, Y, SZ, A, B)

	INTEGER SZ
	REAL X(SZ), Y(SZ)
	REAL A, B

   Using LINEARFIT, write a function to determine A and B for the 
   following functional form:

	Y = A*B**X
