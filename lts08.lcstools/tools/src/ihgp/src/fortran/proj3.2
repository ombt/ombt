CIS 255 Project 3

code and flow charts due 2/12/97

1) The problem is to fit the following function to a sequence 
   of points (X,Y). You are to use the least-squares fit 
   method to calculate the parameters, A and B, in the
   following equation:

	Y = A*X**B

2) Your program should read in a sequence of (X, Y) points
   and print out the corresponding A and B coefficients.

3) Run your program on the following set of points.

	X	Y
