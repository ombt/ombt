CIS 255 Project 4

code due 2/19/97

This project will have you calculate the A and B parameters
of a power curve for 3 different sets of data, i.e., you
will have 3 sets of A and B coefficients. Then, you
will calculate the average and standard deviation for the 
A and B coefficients. Refer to handout for the equations
for the mean and standard deviation.

1) You are to use the least-squares fit method to calculate the 
   parameters, A and B, in the following equation:

	Y = A*X**B

   Your program should read in a set of (X, Y) points and calculate 
   the A and B coefficients. Repeat this procedure for each set of 
   (X, Y) points.

2) The 3 sets of data points are listed below.

	X	Y1	Y2	Y3
   ------------------------------------
	1	1	1	2
	2	3	4	3
	3	10	9	8
	4	15	16	17
	5	27	23	25
	6	39	36	34
	7	48	47	49
	8	60	64	62
	9	80	81	84
	10	104	100	100
	11	120	121	119
	12	140	144	148
	13	164	169	170
	14	200	190	196
	15	230	225	225

3) Calculate the CHI-squared value for each set of (X, Y) points.

4) Calculate the average A and B values using the A and B values
   you calculated in part 1. Also calculate the standard deviation 
   for A and B.

5) Turn in output and flow-chart.
