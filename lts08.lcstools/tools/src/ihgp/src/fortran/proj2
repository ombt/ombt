CIS 255 Project 2 - due 1/29/97 at start of class.

1) The problem is to solve a quadratic equation using the 
   standard quadratic formula (same as project 1). The difference
   is that in this project you have to deal with 3 cases for the
   roots. The cases are:

	1) roots r1 and r2 are real and unequal.
	2) roots r1 and r2 are complex.
	3) roots r1 and r2 are equal and real.

2) The coefficients to the quadratic equation are all real, that is, for
   the following:

	a*x**2 + b*x +c

   coefficients a, b, c are all real.

3) Your program should read in the coefficients a, b, c (same as project
   1) and print out the roots AND whether the roots are complex,
   real and unequal, or real and equal. Use the determinant to
   determine the type of roots.

4) Run your program on all of the following coefficients and turn
   in the output. You should only need to run your program once.

	a	b	c
   ----------------------------
	1	1	-12
	1	10	25
	1	-11	30
	1	-2	2

5) Turn in a flow chart of your program.
