Fixes since the beta version:
-----------------------------
* Added a do-nothing destructor to class StripsObject. Without
  it gcc 2.7.x dies with "virtual memory" exhausted when compiling
  the STRIPS-planner.
  [Thanks to Larry Holder (holder@banzai.uta.edu) for pointing this out!]

* Removed set_startnode() from class AStar because chances
  are that when this function is called the goal node has not been
  initialized yet: set_startnode() calls compute_h() and since
  this function will usually need the goal node it will be accessing
  a NULL computer if the goal node is not yet present.
  Also, removed the 'virtual' attribute' from set_startnode() in
  class Search and class BiSearch.
  [Thanks to Jim Bander (Jim.Bander@umich.edu) and David Hibler
   (dhibler@pcs.cnu.edu) for reporting bug!]

* Made comparelt() in class List const. It is declared const in
  all derived classes and must, therefore, be const in this class too.
  Without this the new definition of the function in the derived
  class won't overwrite the old one with some compilers.
  [Thanks to David Hibler (dhibler@pcs.cnu.edu) for reporting this bug!]

* Removed the empty constructor from class Puzzle in 8puzzle2. In
  the old code this constructor was called from main(). This meant
  that the private variable 'goal' was never initialized and this in turn
  meant that compute_h() would try to dereference a NULL pointer when
  it called get_board() on this variable.
  [Thanks to David Hibler (dhibler@pcs.cnu.edu) for reporting this bug!]
