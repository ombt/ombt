A german ISUP calldata has been prepared for this lab,
If you need to provision German, then use the calldata script
with calldata.GER.

If you need to know if this lab is already German, then
rtrv-mgc-pc, if the response has 4343H-x-x-x-x, then it
is German.  Or try rtrv-sg-pc, if that response is 4343H-x-x-x-x
it is also German.

If you are in a distributed system, then both your mgc and sg point
codes have to match.
So you would need to rtrv-mgc-pc on the mgc
and then rtrv-sg-pc on the sg and make sure they match.
