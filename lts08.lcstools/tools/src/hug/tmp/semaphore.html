<p>This package implements a straight forward semaphore signal and wait
mechanism. Semaphores can go up or down the interpreter hierarchy.
Names within the same interpreter may not contain a "/" character.
To specify a semaphore in a child interpreter, use a semaphore
name of the form child/name which may be recursive. To specify a
semaphore of a parent interpreter, use a semaphore name of the
form ../name which may be recursive.</p>


<dl>
<dt><p><b>::Semaphore::Signal</b> name
    <dd>Signal a semaphore returning the semaphore value after it is signaled.
        It is not possible to determine if a Semaphore::Wait was release
        as a result of the Signal.
        </p>

        <p>Signalling a semaphore may release one of the pending ::Semaphore::Wait
        or incrementing its counter so that a successive ::Semaphore::Wait
        will not block.</p>

        <p>Semaphore names in a child interpreter take on the name of
           {interpreter name}/{semaphore name} in the parent interpreter.
           Children can use the name ../{semaphore name} to signal parent
           semaphore. Siblings may signal each other by using semaphores
           in the parent interpreter.
         </p>

<dt><p><b>::Semaphore::Wait</b> {glob name} ...
    <dd>Wait for a semaphore to be signaled, returning the name
        of the signaled semaphore. This name may be a semaphore
        in a parent or a child interpreter. If the semaphore has
        previously been signaled without a matching wait, then this
        routine will return immediately, returning the name of
        the semaphore that was signaled.</p>

        <p>Semaphore names in a child interpreter take on the name of
           {interpreter name}/{semaphore name} in the parent interpreter.
           Children can use the name ../{semaphore name} to signal parent
           semaphore. Siblings may signal each other by using semaphores
           in the parent interpreter.
         </p>

<dt><p><b>::Semaphore::Reset</b> name
    <dd>Reset for a semaphore. Once a semaphore has been reset, a wait will
        block until a signal is generated. Resetting a semaphore does not signal
        it, which may result in routines waiting on the semaphore that has
        already been signaled and reset, which would then block indefinitely.</p>
