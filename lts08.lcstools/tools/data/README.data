Descriptor files MUST alway have the following form:

field	t\t	l10
lastfield	t\n	l10

where the type and delimiter is either t\t or t\n. the db.sh library
expects this. also, the white space between the fields in the Dfile
should be single tabs.

the relations are used as follows:

1) load-only relations - relations that only concerned with the
loads that are built and not related to lab details.

buildmachines - contains branch, build machine and path to where
tar files are stored. UPDATED by hand.

images - contains a list of images that makes up a "load". it contains
the branch, cpuload, IOM type and name of tar file. UPDATED via saveload 
and removeloads

loads - contains data for branch, cpu load and basedir for text tar
files. filesystems says where different types of files for given 
branches are stored, but loads says specifically where to find
a specific branch,cpuload for text. UPDATED via saveload and removeloads.

2) lab-only relations - 

binary - location of binary backups for labs, keyed by labid, branch and
cpuload. contains directory where binary backup is stored. not currently
used.

chassis - contains the ip addresses for SP-A and SP-B for a chassis.
type field describes the type of chassis: lcs, mg, mgc, sg. contains
the labid for the chassis and the branch that supports this configuration.

chassis2ioms - contains a list of IOMs associated for a chassis. the data
are keyed by branch and labid. used by reload to determine which IOM
images are required.

labloads - list of loads available for each lab. keyed by labid, branch and
cpuload. updated by saveload, lcsconfigure and removeloads. used by reload.

labs - list of labs and branches supported for each lab. contains a flag
to indicate if lab is distributed. this information can also be obtained
from the chassis relation. relations chassis and labs are almost
redundant. not used.

scripts - tl1 scripts for given lab, branch and cpuload. assigns a script
name, sequence number and base path. not used.

3) load and lab-related relations -

filesystems - contains base directories where to store text tar files,
TL1 scripts for labs and binary backups for labs for a given branch
and file type: text, scripts, binary. UPDATED by hand.

parameters - miscellaneous name=value pairs. keyed by name, returns
value. not used as of now.

4) hardware-related relations - 

hwioms - describes the ioms in each chassis. it contains the data
for ent-eqpt and ent-eqpt-all TL1 cmds. the tool hw2ioms generates
this relation from the Tl1 scripts. the relation chassis2ioms is 
built using the data in this relation.

hwchassis - contains the data for ed-chassis-eqpt TL1 cmds. the field
data are contained as name-value pairs, rather than having a separate
field for each parameter and having most of the fields be empty.
the tool hw2chassis generates this relation from the Tl1 scripts.

hwenet - contains enet information.

hwtdm - contains trunking information.
