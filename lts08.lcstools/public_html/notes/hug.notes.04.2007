1 - preliminary steps

rtrv-chassis-eqpt to get chassis types. allowed chassis types are:

SG ==>> Lucent SG - Lucent Signaling Gateway
MGC ==>> Lucent NC - Lucent Network Controller
MG ==>> Lucent NG - Lucent Network Gateway
SG_MGC ==>> Lucent CC - Lucent Compact Controller
SG_MGC_MG ==>> Lucent CS - Lucent Compact Switch
SG_MG ==>> Lucent SG/NG - Combined Lucent Signaling Gateway and Network Gateway

task index list contains list for upgrading and downgrading the 
switches listed above.

switch. upgrading procedures for IOMs:

		Controller
	<a href="DLP/DLP-754" target="contents">DLP-754</a> - SG_MG - Upgrading IOM Software of a Combined Lucent 
		Signaling Gateway and Network Gateway

2.8) upgrading spare SPs of a 6.x and higher lucent gateway platform switch:

	update the spare rear SPs to keep them consistent.

2.9) upgrading spare IOms of a 6.x and higher lucent gateway platform switch:
	
	update the spare IOMs to keep them consistent.

2.10) out-of-service upgrades and downgrades - in-service upgrades are not
supported for all releases. refer to release notes to determine if in-service
upgrade is supported. if an out-of-service upgrade is required, then the
configuration data are deleted and the switch have to be reprovisioned.

2.11) out-of-service downgrades are performed if the new software is not
acceptable. an out-of-service downgrade will remove all configuration data
and the switch will have to be reprovisioned.

2.12) Out-of Service Upgrades from Version 5.X or 6.X to 6.2 For
	Geographical Redundant Systems

2.13) Swapping SPs and IOMs

In a geographically redundant configuration, there are two sites with a 
Lucent SG and a Lucent NC at each site. They control 1-n Lucent MGs. If there 
has been a catastrophic failure at the primary, a switch to the secondary or 
redundant switch can be done with minimal loss of calls and traffic. The 
version of software and the configuration database at each site must be 
identical.

During an out of service upgrade, switches will be down and calls will fail 
and be dropped at points during the upgrade process. To minimize down time, 
during an upgrade to 6.2 the rear SPs will be replaced with SPs with the new 
software version and the customer's database and front IOMs will be replaced 
with IOMs with the new software version. To accomplish this, the customer's 
database must be backed up and sent to Lucent Technologies. Lucent will 
update rear SPs and front IOMs and then send them to the customer site for 
the replacement and upgrade procedures.

During this time, if the customer makes configuration changes, the customer is
responsible for updating the database with these changes after the upgrade is
completed.

In a geographically redundant configuration, the secondary site will be 
upgraded first. Then a switch will be made to the primary site that will 
then be upgraded.

After the Lucent SG and NCs at the primary and secondary sites have been
upgraded, the Lucent MGs can be upgraded to 6.2.

2.14) Swapping SPs and Upgrading IOMs

This upgrade is similar to the previous upgrade of swapping both the SPs and
IOMs, except only the SPs are swapped. The IOMs must be upgraded using the
procedures listed in the following table. This type of upgrade takes more time
than swapping both SPs and IOMs.

	<a href="DLP/DLP-754" target="contents">DLP-754</a> Upgrading IOM Software of a Combined Lucent Signaling
		Gateway and Network Gateway

2.15) Out of Service Upgrade of SPs and IOMS

This type of upgrade takes the longest time to complete. Before the upgrade a
backup of the database must be sent to Lucent for upgrading to 6.2. When the
database is returned, an out-of-service upgrade is performed which removes the
existing database and upgrades the SPs and IOMs to the new version. The
updated database must then be restored to the switch. This type of upgrade takes
the longest time.

2.16) Out-of Service Upgrades from Version 5.X or 6.X to 6.2 For Non-
Geographical Redundant Systems

2.16.1) Swapping SPs and IOMs
This upgrade swaps both the SPs and the IOMs and allows the upgrade to be
accomplished in the shortest amount of time.

2.16.2) Swapping SPs and Upgrading IOMs
This upgrade is similar to the previous upgrade of swapping both the SPs and
IOMs, except only the SPs are swapped. The IOMs must be upgraded using the
procedures listed in the following table. This type of upgrade takes more time
than swapping both SPs and IOMs.

2.16.3) Out of Service Upgrade of SPs and IOMS

This type of upgrade takes the longest time to complete. Before the upgrade a
backup of the database must be sent to Lucent for upgrading to 6.2. When the
database is returned, an out-of-service upgrade is performed which removes the
existing database and upgrades the SPs and IOMs to the new version. The
updated database must then be restored to the switch. This type of upgrade takes
the longest time.

3.2.1) Upgrading Geographically Redundant Switches to Version 6.2

To upgrade a Lucent Gateway Platform switch, one of the three procedures 
must be performed.  In these procedures a Lucent SG, a Lucent NC and 
Lucent NGs will be upgraded.

3.2.2) Upgrading Non-geographically Redundant Switches to Version 6.2

To upgrade a Lucent Gateway Platform switch, one of following procedures 
must be performed.  You can upgrade

	- By swapping both the SPs and IOMs,
	- By swapping only the SPs and upgrading the IOMs using the 
	CPY-MEM command or
	- By upgrading the SPs and IOMs using the CPY-MEM command.
