<h3> DLP-700 - PREPARING FOR AN IN-SERVICE CHANGE OF SYSTEM PROCESSOR SOFTWARE </h3>
<pre>

SUMMARY: This procedure provides steps to prepare to change the software on the System
Processors of the switch. This may include patch software, X.X.X.X.SP.X.

The switch may be any of the switch types identified in the following table.

chassisType returned by RTRV-CHASSIS-EQPT

SG - Lucent Signaling Gateway Lucent SG
MGC - Lucent Network Controller Lucent NC
MG - Lucent Network Gateway Lucent NG
SG_MGC_MG - Lucent Compact Switch Lucent CS
SG_MGC - Lucent Compact Controller Lucent CC
SG_MG - Combined Lucent Signaling Gateway and Network Gateway Lucent SG/NG

In a distributed architecture, you should first change the software of the 
Lucent SG, then the Lucent NC and finally the Lucent NG. If changing 
software of a Lucent CC, it should be changed before the Lucent NG.

Logon Tl1 and list the software versions for the IOMs and the SP, get the IPs
from RTRV-CHASSIS-EQPT command and check where CurrRel points to: /Telica/swCPU
or /home1/Telica/swCPU.

Order for upgrading the software:

	SG ==>> MGC ==>> MG
or,
	SG_MGC ==>> MG

I assume you need to do the MGC before any MG, so:

	MGC ==>> SG_MG

Get this info also:

	Software versions for SPs and IOMs.
	IPs from RTRV-EQPT command.
	Where CurrRel points to, either /Telica/swCPU or /home1/Telica/swCPU.
	Determine the active SP, ether SP-A or SP-B.
	Determine active IOMs, secondary IOMs, and IOM types.
	Determine current disk usage on both SPs.
