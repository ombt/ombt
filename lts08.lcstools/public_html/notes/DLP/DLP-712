<h3> DLP-712 PREPARING FOR CHANGING IOM SOFTWARE </h3>
<pre>

1) Logon the active SP. You can use the login/passwd of root/plexus9000.

	$ df

If the disk space usage on /dev/hd2b is over 68%, then delete old files that 
are not needed. Here are some of the files that can be removed:

	/Telica/swCraft - only current version should there.
	/Telica/swXXX - only current IOM tar files should exist.
	All *.gz files not part of the current load.

2) Repeat this procedure on the standby SP.

3) There should sufficient space to receive and expand the new IOM 
tar files. 

Question: should this procedure be done after both SPs are upgraded?
