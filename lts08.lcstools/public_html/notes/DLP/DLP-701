<h3> DLP-701 CHECKING MEMORY FOR A CHANGE OF SYSTEM PROCESSOR SOFTWARE </h3>
<pre>

1) Determine the active SP using RTRV-EQPT.

2) Determine which partition CurrRel points to:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/Telica/swCPU/CurrRel;

If the response is ../../Telica/swCPU/X.X.X.X.X, then / is the 
active partition.

If the response is ../../home1/Telica/swCPU/X.X.X.X.X, then /home1 is the 
active partition.

3) Determine if there are older releases in the other partition. 

If CurrRel points to /Telica/swCPU, then check of there are old CPU loads
under /home1/Telica/swCPU:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/home1/Telica/swCPU

If CurrRel points to /home1/Telica/swCPU, then check if there are old CPU 
loads under /Telica/swCPU:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/Telica/swCPU
	

4) If there are older CPU loads, then remove them. 

If an older load, say /home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y exists, then do
this:

	EXEC-RM:::::-r,/home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

If an older load, say /Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y exists, then do
this:

	EXEC-RM:::::-r,/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

Verify the load is missing as follows:

For old load /Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y, do this:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

Nothing should be listed if he directory was delete. 

For old load /home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y, do this:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

Nothing should be listed if he directory was delete. 

Repeat this procedure until all old loads are removed. 

5) Remove the standby processor by using the RMV-EQPT command.

If SP-A is standby, then enter:

	RMV-EQPT::SP-A;

If SP-B is standby, then enter:

	RMV-EQPT::SP-B;

6) Restore the standby SP using the RST-EQPT command.


If SP-A is standby, then enter:

	RST-EQPT::SP-A;

If SP-B is standby, then enter:

	RST-EQPT::SP-B;

7) Verify the standby SP has the state, IS,STBYH when the restore
is done. Use RTRV-EQPT to verify.

8) Now switch to the protection processor.

If SP-A is active, enter this:

	SW-TOPROTN-EQPT::SP-A

If SP-B is active, enter this:

	SW-TOPROTN-EQPT::SP-B

Use RTRV-EQPT to verify the new processor becomes IS,ACT. 

If SP-A was standby, now it should be active with a state of IS,ACT.
If SP-B was standby, now it should be active with a state of IS,ACT.

Now, repeat the above procedure with the new active processor.

9) Determine which partition CurrRel points to:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/Telica/swCPU/CurrRel;

If the response is ../../Telica/swCPU/X.X.X.X.X, then / is the 
active partition.

If the response is ../../home1/Telica/swCPU/X.X.X.X.X, then /home1 is the 
active partition.

10) Determine if there are older releases in the other partition. 

If CurrRel points to /Telica/swCPU, then check of there are old CPU loads
under /home1/Telica/swCPU:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/home1/Telica/swCPU

If CurrRel points to /home1/Telica/swCPU, then check if there are old CPU 
loads under /Telica/swCPU:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/Telica/swCPU
	

11) If there are older CPU loads, then remove them. 

If an older load, say /home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y exists, then do
this:

	EXEC-RM:::::-r,/home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

If an older load, say /Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y exists, then do
this:

	EXEC-RM:::::-r,/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

Verify the load is missing as follows:

For old load /Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y, do this:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

Nothing should be listed if he directory was delete. 

For old load /home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y, do this:

	EXEC-LS:::::-l,/home1/Telica/swCPU/Y.Y.Y.Y.Y

Nothing should be listed if he directory was delete. 

Repeat this procedure until all old loads are removed. 

12) You are done. The active SP should be the SP that was initially
standby before this procedure was started.
