Hi Amy,

I would like to propose an article describing a template-based 
shared-memory class for the UNIX environment. The class has the unique 
feature that it calls the default constructor when the shared memory is 
first created and calls the destructor when the shared memory is released
by the creating-process, not by any other process accessing the shared-
memory data. Basically, you don't want other processes creating or 
destroying the shared-memory data as the processes attach and detach 
from the shared-memory data. 

The model used in the class is useful for system processes that fork
child processes as helpers (a typical architecture for client/server
systems). 

As for my background, CUJ has previously published two of my articles 
so I'm in your database !!!

Thank you !!!
