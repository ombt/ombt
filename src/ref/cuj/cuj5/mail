Hi Marc,

I was curious if CUJ is interested in articles about Artificial Intelligence 
methods, in particular, best-first heuristic search of a problem state-space.
Since last summer I've been learning about AI, and I believe that your
readers may be interested in a templatized best-first search that I wrote
while learning about AI. The search routine is based on the algorithm
described in two books: Principles of Artificial Intelligence, by
Nils Nilsson, and Heuristics: Intelligent Search Strategies for Computer
Problem Solving by J. Pearl (the bible for heuristic search methods).

The code was tested with several of the "classic" AI problems: N-queens,
missionary-cannibals, eight-cube, and a coins problem which may not be
so "classic."

Please let me know if there is any interest. Thank you !!!

Hi Amy:

Last week I sent an email with a proposal for an article on
heuristic search of a state-space. After I sent it I realized 
that I really did not explain why I thought the article would be
of interest to CUJ readers. Basically, this last year I have 
been learning about artificial inteligence so that I can create
an expert system for work. What I found was that most of the 
problems in AI really boil down to efficiently traversing a 
directed graph. This is true for games, theorem proving, the
computing language Prolog, and diagnostic programs (what I 
am working on), for example. What all this means is that a 
programmer must have a good understanding of search techniques 
to solve AI problems. The article I proposed is on the "best-first"
heuristic search algorithm for traversing a problem state-space.
This method is used to solve many of the "classic" AI problems,
N-queens, missionary and cannibals, and the 8-square. In many 
AI books (Nils Nilsson's Principles of AI, for example), the first
topic covered is heuristic search, best-first search.

Sorry about sending this with the first email. Thank you for your
interest.

     Mike,
     
     Thanks for the clarification. I'm forwarding this on to Marc Briand, 
     who actually reviews the proposals. Thanks again,

Hi Mike,

We definitely are interested. The problem I've seen with AI type
articles (e.g., articles describing genetic algorithms) is that the
author focuses so much on describing how the algorithm works that he
doesn't give the reader a clue as to how to adapt his/her problem to the
code. So the example or examples you give should clearly illustrate the
process by which a user "hooks" his/her problem into the code. You
should also probably say a little bit about what kinds of problems are
appropriate and what kinds are best suited to other approaches.

I would like to see an article of around 2500 to 3000 words. I'd like to
receive a draft by the end of February. BTW -- I am assuming Lucent has
no ownership issues with this code?

Marc

Hi Marc,

I can definitely have the article by the end of February,
and Lucent has no problems since the code was written
while I was learning about AI. It really has no use for
the work I do around here. 

I can gear the article to give a quick introduction as to how 
the code searches a directed graph. Then I can use two of the
test cases to show how to use the search routine, i.e., adapt
there problem to the search routine. Does that sound ok?
