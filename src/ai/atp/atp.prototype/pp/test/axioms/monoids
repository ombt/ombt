# axioms for monoids
#
# monoids are defined using the following language:
#
# L(M) = { *, 1 } where * is binary, and 1 is a constant.
#
# the axioms for monoids are then:
#
# (x * y) * z = x * (y * z)
# (x * 1) = x
# (1 * x) = x
#
# let M be "*"

M(M(x, y), z) = M(x, M(y, z));
M(x, 1) = x;
M(1, x) = x;
